===== Algorithm =====

The redirection by best name page is an simple algorithm which occurs to find the best page by name.

It calculate a score for two kinds of page :

  * the start pages of a namespace
  * the pages with the same name

===== Conf =====

A [[#weight factor]] [[:configuration|configuration]] is applied and in this way, you can influence the redirection :

  * When a page have the same name (by default 4)
  * When a page is a start page of a namespace (by default 3)
  * When a namespace match (by default 5)

===== Example =====


  * The page asked : ''namespace1:namespace2:pagename''
  * We have one page with the same name : ''namespace1:pagename''
  * We have one startpage : ''namespace1:namespace2:start''

**Score :**

  * The score for the page with the same name is : 9 = 5 (because namespace1 is present in the asked page) + 4 (because the page name match)
  * The score for the startpage is : 13 = 5 (because namespace1 is present in the asked page) + 5 (because namespace2 is present in the asked page) + 3 (because it's a start page)

In this case, the startpage is the redirect page because it have a highest score (13 against 9)
