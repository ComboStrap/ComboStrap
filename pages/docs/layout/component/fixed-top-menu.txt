<code dw>
<menubar position="top">
<brand title="ComboStrap Home">
<icon name="logo.svg" />
ComboStrap (Beta)
</brand>
</menubar>
</code>

For a complete and detailed instruction, see [[docs:getting_started:5_menu]]

==== Set the height of the menu bar ====

The ''heightFixedTopNavbar'' [[:configuration|strap configuration]] permits to change automatically all style in order to move the top location of the page.

You need to set the height of your [[docs:menubar:menubar|menu bar]]

<note tip>
With a menu bar that uses only on one line, it should be ''40px''.

===== Features =====

A ''fixed-top'' [[docs:menubar:menubar|menu bar]] gives a great experience but is difficult to implement because they needs some extra styling in order to relocate:
  * the top location of the page
  * the location of the [[docs:content:heading|heading]]
Without this changements, a navigation via a link to an [[docs:content:heading|heading]] would land below the fixed-top menu and will then cache the heading.

''ComboStrap'' is ''fixed-top menu'' ready and permits to implement it with a couple of parameters. See the [[#how_to_configure_a_fixed-top_menu|steps]]
