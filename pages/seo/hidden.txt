====== ComboStrap SEO - Hidden Page / Resource ======


===== About =====
A ''hidden'' resource (page, image, file, ...) is a resource that is:
  * not published to [[kb>search:engine|Search Engine]] (ie not included in the [[seo:sitemap|sitemap]] and not pinged)
  * not included 
      * in the [[ui:ntoc|sidebar menu]]
      * in the change log feeds
  * not visible:
      * when searching
      * in internal backlinks.

<note>
In short, the page is still accessible directly (with its URL) but is no more visible.
