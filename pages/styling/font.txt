====== ComboStrap - Font ======


===== About =====


===== Responsive =====
''Responsive font'' means that the size of the font is adapting to each [[styling:breakpoint|screen size]].

It means that on a smaller screen, a [[ui:heading|heading font size]] should become lower to not take the whole height of the screen.

===== Support =====

==== Bootstrap note =====

[[release:1.13_bootstrap5|Bootstrap version 5]] does implement responsive size [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/typography/#responsive-font-sizes|by default]]. ''ComboStrap'' does not apply therefore the fix of Bootstrap 4 for the [[ui:title|title]]

It has introduced the [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/rfs/|RFS module (Responsive Font Sizes)]] that reacts also to styling properties with unit values like:
  * [[styling:spacing|margin, padding]], 
  * [[styling:border|border-radius]], 
  * or even [[styling:shadow|box-shadow]].
