====== ComboStrap Styling - Length Scale (Size Scale) ======

===== About =====
Every length are scaled based on what's called the [[kb>rem|rem (Root Emphemeral Unit)]] which is equal by default to ''16px''.

The scale is going:
  * from ''1'' for a length value of ''.25rem'' 
  * to ''5'' for a length value of ''3rem'' 



This scale is used for [[font|font]] and [[styling:spacing|spacing]]

===== Responsive =====
Every browser sets a value of ''16px'' for one ''rem'' and does not take into account the [[styling:breakpoint|screen size]].




==== Boostrap4 ====

[[bootstrap|Bootstrap4]] does not vary this value depending on the [[styling:breakpoint|screen size]] [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/typography/#responsive-font-sizes|by default]], ''ComboStrap'' does it.
