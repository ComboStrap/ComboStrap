  * the [[#user_stylesheet|user stylesheet level]] - a stylesheet with custom rule to tune the styling precisely
  * the [[#attribute level]] - inline css customization
      * [[#standard|standard]] - a set of the most important attributes to quickly style any components.
      * and [[#advanced|advanced]] which let's you use the full power of HTML and CSS.

==== Bootstrap Stylesheet ====

''ComboStrap'' is based on ''Bootstrap'' and comes with pre-packaged stylesheets. You can even create and install your own bootstrap stylesheet.

The ''standard'' attributes are:

  * [[styling:align|Align]] - Align your component and their text as you wish
  * [[styling:spacing|Spacing]] - Master your layout at the pixel-perfect details
  * [[color|Color]] - Text, Border and Background color made easy with name and declarative gradient
