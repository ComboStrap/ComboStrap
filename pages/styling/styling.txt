====== ComboStrap UI Styling ======


===== About =====
''Styling'' in ''ComboStrap'' is the possibility to render every [[ui:ui|component]] as you wish.

''ComboStrap'' has three levels of styling:
  * the [[#bootstrap stylesheet|bootstrap stylesheet level]] - bootstrap standard theme
  * the [[#user_stylesheet|user stylesheet level]] - a stylesheet with custom rule to tune the styling precisely
  * the [[#attribute level]] - inline css customization
      * [[#standard|standard]] - a set of the most important attributes to quickly style any components.
      * and [[#advanced|advanced]] which let's you use the full power of HTML and CSS.

==== Bootstrap Stylesheet ====

''ComboStrap'' is based on ''Bootstrap'' and comes with pre-packaged stylesheets. You can even create and install your own bootstrap stylesheet.

==== User Stylesheet ====

This functionality gives the possibility to the web designer to create their own CSS rules in a custom stylesheet in order to tune the theme exactly to their needs.

==== Attributes ====

=== Standard  ===
The ''standard'' attributes are:
  * [[styling:dimension|Dimension (Width and height)]] - Take control of the dimensions
  * [[styling:align|Align]] - Align your component and their text as you wish
  * [[styling:spacing|Spacing]] - Master your layout at the pixel-perfect details
  * [[color|Color]] - Text, Border and Background color made easy with name and declarative gradient
  * [[styling:shadow|Elevation]] - Add a shadow and elevate your component
  * [[float|Float]] - Position a component to the right or left and let the content flows along its side
  * [[release:beta:position|Position]] - Position a component inside a container
  * [[clickable|Clickable]] - Make a whole component such as a card clickable
  * [[text-align|Text align]] - Align the lines inside a block
  * [[ui:text#line-spacing|Line Spacing]] - Set the height between lines of text
  * [[opacity|Opacity]] - Renders a component more or less opaque / transparent 

<note>
=== For the Geek ===
''Standard attributes'' are all transformed into [[style|CSS rules]].
</note>


=== Animation ===
  * [[release:beta:onvisible|OnVisible]] - Add an animation when a component become visible
  * [[hover|OnHover]] - Add an animation when the mouse is over a component

=== Advanced ===
Every component is a [[styling:html|html superset]] and you can therefore use the HTML attributes:
  * [[class|class]]
  * and [[style|style]]
for advanced styling.

You can also create your own rule in the [[styling:userstyle|userstyle.css stylesheet]] if you have CSS knowledge.
