====== ComboStrap UI Styling ======


===== About =====
''Styling'' in ''ComboStrap'' is the possibility to render every [[ui:ui|component]] as you wish.

''ComboStrap'' has two levels of styling:
  * [[#Standard|Standard]] - a set of the most important attributes to quickly style any components.
  * and [[#advanced|Advanced]] which let's you use the full power of HTML and CSS.

===== Attributes =====

==== Standard  ====
The ''standard'' attributes are:
  * [[styling:dimension|Dimension (Width and height)]] - Take control of the space
  * [[styling:align|Align]] - Align your component and their text as you wish
  * [[styling:spacing|Spacing]] - Master your layout at the pixel-perfect details
  * [[color|Color]] - Text, Border and Background color made easy with name and declarative gradient
  * [[skin|Skin]] - Apply a color skin to master the emphasis of your components
  * [[styling:elevation|Elevation]] - Add a shadow to give more emphasis to a component

<note>
=== For the Geek ===
''Standard attributes'' are all transformed into [[style|CSS rules]].
</note>


==== Advanced ====
Every component is a [[styling:html|html superset]] and you can therefore use the HTML attributes:
  * [[class|class]]
  * and [[style|style]]
for advanced styling
