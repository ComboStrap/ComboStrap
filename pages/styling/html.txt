===== Syntax =====
Every [[ui:ui|UI component]] follows the following syntax
<code dw>
<component type name1="value1" ... nameN="valueN" >
<!-- content -->
</component>
</code>
where:
  * ''type'' is the [[type|type of component]]. Not every component has a type but if it's the case, you don't need to set a name for it.
  * ''nameX="valueX"'' are attributes that may be:
      * specific to this component
      * the [[#styling|styling attributes]]
      * or the [[#html|html attributes]]





==== Styling ====
Every component implements also a set of [[styling|styling attributes]]

Example: 
  * The tree [[styling:color|colors attributes]] can be passed natively. You can write:
<code dw>
<component color="blue">
</code>
  * The dimension attributes (''width'' and ''height'') are also taken into account in each component. You can write:
<code dw>
<component width="100px">
</code>
  * [[styling:styling|More  ? See the styling attributes]]

==== HTML ====

All HTML attributes are supported on every component and in particularly, you may use the:
  * [[class|class]]
  * [[styling:style|style]]
for [[styling#advanced|advanced styling]]
