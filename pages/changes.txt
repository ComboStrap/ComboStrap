===== Releases =====






==== Version 1.12 - 2021-03-19 ====

This is release that has started with a couple of request and ended big. 

The most important features are:
  * the addition of the [[social|social module]]
  * the [[ui:link|link]] component accepts now children component.

Check the below changes to know more about all of them:
  * [[ui:webcode|webcode]] is now integrated in Combo. The code is taken from the calls because the regular expression for the update lexer mode was not catching the code when there was whitespace.
  * [[styling:elevation|elevation]] - a new elevation level was added called ''high'' that elevates on all side of the box.
  * the disabling of [[ui:preformatted|preformated]] has been improved by not allowing this mode via the ''accept'' function of the syntax class.
  * the ''combostrap'' logo got a fix color to be able to embedded it via object.
  * the [[ui:code|code]] element supports now the code export functionality of dokuwiki.
  * New component: [[ui:accordion|accordion]] lets you lay out [[ui:panel|panel]] in a ''accordion'' fashion.
  * New syntax for [[ui:tabs|tabs]]. The syntax of the [[ui:tabs|tabs component]] was too complicated. We have deprecated the [[deprecated:tabs|old syntax]] in favor of a new one based on [[ui:panel|panel]]. It brings the fact that [[ui:accordion|accordion]] and [[ui:tabs|tabs]] are the same navigational element on two differents layouts.
  * New skin for [[ui:tabs|tabs]] called ''enclosed-tabs'' and ''enclosed-pills'' that will enclose the tabs within a border.
  * New syntax [[ui:link|link]] element. The dokuwiki link element allows only text or image as description. This link component enhances the syntax and allows any component as description ([[ui:link#icon|icon]] for instance)
  * New [[ui:button|button]] HTML generation. If a button has a link in its description, the HTML generated is a link with a button role. This corrects the XHTML compliancy problem and makes the button clickable on its whole surface.
  * New configuration to disable totally the [[quality:dynamic_monitoring|dynamic quality monitoring]] feature.
  * Link Styling breaking change: 
      * the [[ui:dropdown|dropdown link]] in the [[ui:navbar|navbar]] got a ''active'' class. This was not right and was deleted. Unfortunately, it has an effect on the styling.
      * the dokuwiki class ''wikilink1'' (existing page) and ''wikilink2'' (not existing page) were adding extra styling rules that were incompatible with Bootstrap. They have been changed by new name but it's still possible to get them back with [[ui:link#useDokuwikiLinkClassName|useDokuwikiLinkClassName configuration]].
      * ''wikilink2'' was changed with ''text-warning'' to show visually that the page does not exist
  * New [[ui:image|Image page]] to show how to elevate an image
  * Bug: The [[strap:bar|bar pages]] are not anymore set as [[quality:low_quality_page|low quality page]].
  * Twitter aware: ComboStrap pages are now [[semantic:twitter|twitter aware and renders in tweet as cards]].
  * Facebook aware: ComboStrap pages are now [[semantic:facebook|facebook]].
  * New: [[:social|social page]] to concentrate on one page all the social features.
  * New Page Metadata - the [[semantic:image|page of an image]] used in card social illustration.
  * Improved: the [[semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]] creates a link to debug quickly the json if there is any errors.
  * New: You can advertise your organization by creating an [[semantic:organization|organization page]].
  * New: [[semantic:google|Google Rich Result]] aware. The below ''rich results'' are created automatically if you set the [[semantic:type|type]] of page.
      * [[semantic:website|Search Box]], 
      * [[semantic:organization|Logo (Organization)]]
      * [[semantic:article|Article Card]]
  * New: [[quality:lpp|Late Publication Protection]] - Start writing a page now and publish it later.
  * New: For internal and debug purpose: The version of Combostrap is now available in a ''html meta'' generator tag and in the title of the footer link.
  * Bug: [[ui:dropdown|dropdown]] was not attributes aware. You can now add styling class to hide dropdown depending on the screen width. 
  * New anchor. Every [[ui:heading|heading]] has now an anchor to help get a direct link.
  * New component: [[ui:tweet|tweet]] to embed tweet in your pages.
  * New: Style and Javascript Dokuwiki independency: Combostrap does not depend anymore on Dokuwiki Style and Javascript engine. All component snippets are embedded individually on each page only when used.


==== Version 1.11 - 2021-02-02 ====

List:
  * The following monospaces component were added with the [[styling:prism|prism library]] to add feature such as prompt, copy text and syntax highlighting.
     * The [[ui:file|file component]] -  a file
     * The [[ui:code|code component]] - a code
     * The [[ui:console|console component]] - a console
  * Added documentation over the [[styling:userstyle|userstyle]] or how to bring its own css rules.
  * Regression fixed: the section ''highlighting'' change of the previous release has removed the default header style.
  * [[quality:automatic_hidden|New automatic hidden page]]: the internal page such as the bars and namespace are now automatically hidden. No configuration is needed.
  * New: a new [[ui:box|Box]] component was introduced to group other component and allows for instance to define a [[ui:collapse|collapse]] target.
  * New: the [[ui:preformatted|preformatted mode]] of dokuwiki is disabled by default in order to be able to write hierarchical block.
  * New: the [[ui:collapse#attribute|collapse attribute]]: a control element such as a [[ui:button|button]] with this attribute can collapse a target component.
  * Fix:  Deleted the clearfix ''group'' class css style of dokuwiki that was giving a line break on the [[styling:prism#regex_language|prism regex language]].
  * New: [[analytics:analytics|analytics module]] that adds [[analytics:data|analytical data]] on [[analytics:statistics|page statistics]] and [[quality:quality|quality]] (with automatic refresh when backlinks are created or deleted).
  * New: [[quality:quality|quality  module]] with [[quality:lqpp|low quality page protection]], [[quality:score|quality score]] and [[quality:rule|quality rules]]
  * New ''auto frontmatter'' feature  - a [[semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]] is created for a new page
  * New ''h1'': The [[semantic:h1|h1 metadata]] has been added in order to have the notion of a short [[semantic:title|title page]].


==== Version 1.10 - 2021-01-09 ====


List:
  * Added [[https://bootswatch.com/|Bootswatch theme]] in the [[styling:stylesheet|stylesheet]]
  * A ''link'' has now a transparent background by default to avoid getting a rectangle in the [[ui:button|button]] with the ''bootswatch'' theme.
  * ''Section Highlighting'' of Dokuwiki has been replaced because it was moving the edit button around. We put now just a light background on hover.
  * Bug: No ''rewrite of the links'' when the page is moved. Combo takes over the links in the bootstrap component such as [[ui:button|button]], [[ui:cite|cite]] in order to set the Bootstrap style. Because the move plugin takes into account the standard dokuwiki link detection, they were not rewritten.

==== Version 1.9 - 2020-10-31 ====
The version 1.9 was a bug fix release.
  * Bug: A Dokuwiki table inside a [[deprecated:tabs#tabpanel|tabpanel]] was giving wrongfully a warning.
  * Bug: The ''data-name'' attribute is used by illustrator to set layer information and was causing a problem in the [[ui:icon|icon]] component.
  * Bug: The failed state HTML element of the file uploader (ie the form in the media manager) was visible by default. A css rule was added to default it to none. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/dokuwiki-template-strap/commit/128140f1aeaba52dfa5afe80059c2dd623a9b0c1|commit]]
  * Bug: [[ui:ntoc|Ntoc]], [[ui:related|Related]], [[ui:cite|cite]] - PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 98570240 bytes) in inc/Cache/CacheInstructions.php on line 44 -
      * The Dokuwiki function ''p_get_metadata'' can render and create a recursive call, we get the title now without rendering.
      * The ''handler call tree'' was returned as return argument of the ''handle'' function, we don't pass it anymore
  * Improvement: Expected ''Php warning'' does not appear anymore in the log (for instance when trying the decode a string as XML to see if it's an XML)

The version 1.8 was a bug fix release.
  * Bug: [[strap:sidekickbor|sidekickbar]] configuration was missspeld to ''sideckickbar'' in place of ''sidekickbar''
  * Bug: Check if the php sqlite extension is installed. When it was not installed, the SQLite Plugin returns a null value.
  * Bug: [[ui:ntoc|Navigational Toc]] was not rendering correctly sub-namespace due to a bad predicate, index page was not filtered due to a semi-colon, the directory were rendering as a page if there was no template and as it was cached, the result was not accurate if the namespace was showing a parent sidebar
