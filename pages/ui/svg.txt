====== ComboStrap UI - SVG ======


===== About =====
''Svg'' are supported natively as [[image|image]]


They are by default [[#optimization|optimized]]

If they have:
  * a small size, they are [[#inclusion|included]] directly to the web page
  * a big size, they are:
      * [[#lazy loading|lazy loaded]]
      * and [[#injection|injected]] as markup


<note>
This features apply also to the [[icon|icon component]]
</note>


===== Example =====


<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
{{ :combostrap:background:object-multicolor.svg?400 |}}
</code>
</webcode>



===== Features =====

==== Inclusion =====
If the SVG file has a size that is less or equal to the [[#svgMaxInlineSize]] configuration, the SVG is directly included into the HTML document as markup
Otherwise, it is added as a image.

This is a tradeoff configuration between the size of your web page and the cost of downloading your SVG file.



==== Lazy Loading ====
By default all big SVG file are lazy loaded meaning that they are downloaded only when they are going to be seen (enter into the screen).

If you don't want this feature, you can disable it in the [[#configuration|configuration]].

==== Injection ====
Big SVG file are downloaded and then injected as SVG markup. It's then possible to style them with CSS property.



If you don't want this feature, you can disable it in the [[#configuration|configuration]].

==== Optimization ====
Svg Optimization is the reduction of the file size by deleting unneeded information in the returned SVG.

We are following a subset of the optimization rules than [[https://github.com/svg/svgo#built-in-plugins|SvgO]]:
  * remove doctype
  * remove comments
  * remove metadata
  * clean ID's
  * Remove empty defs
  * Remove empty elements
  * Remove namespace
  * Remove title
  * Remove desc
  * Remove Style element
  * Remove Script element



You can disable and/or tune the optimizations with the help of the [[#svgOptimizationEnable|svg optimization configurations]].

<note>
If you want to see the effect or optimized manually your SVG, you can go to the [[https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/|SVGOMG tool]].

==== Upload permission ====

By default, the svg files cannot be uploaded because they can contain code. Only the ''admin'' user can upload a SVG.

If you want to allow users to upload, you need to:
  * set the group that is allowed to upload a SVG in the [[#svgUploadGroupName|svgUploadGroupName]] configuration.
  * add the user to this group.

===== Configuration =====

==== svgMaxInlineSize ====
The ''svgMaxInlineSize'' [[:configuration|configuration]] is the maximum file size until a SVG file is included directly in the web page.

With a default of ''2Kb'', all small SVG file such as [[ui:icon|icon]] are automatically included. The browser does not need to download them.

==== svgOptimizationEnable ====
By default, the [[#optimization]] are enabled. This configuration permits to disable this feature.

The below configuration permits to control how the optimization is peformed.
=== svgOptimizationNamespacesToKeep ===
This configuration set the namespace ''prefix''  (not the http URI but the name) that should be kept separated by a comma.

By default, the optimization will delete all namespace.

=== svgOptimizationAttributesToDelete ===
The attributes to delete on all nodes.

By default, we are deleting the ''id'' and ''style'' attributes.


=== svgOptimizationElementsToDelete ===
The elements to delete on the whole SVG.

By default, we delete the following elements:
  * [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/script|script]]: No script can be injected via ''SVG''.
  * [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/title|title]]
  * [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/desc|desc]]





==== svgLazyLoadEnable ====
By default, the SVG files that have a size bigger than the [[#svgmaxinlinesize|maximum inline size]] are [[#lazy Loading|lazy loaded]]. 

This configuration permits to disable this feature.


==== svgInjectionEnable ====
By default, the SVG files that have a size bigger than the [[#svgmaxinlinesize|maximum inline size]] are [[#injection|injected]]. 

This configuration permits to disable this feature.
