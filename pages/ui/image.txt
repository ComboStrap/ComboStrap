====== ComboStrap UI - Image ======

===== About =====
''image'' is a [[block|block UI Component]] that permits to show [[raster|raster]] or [[svg|svg]] images from your media library in your pages

{{backlinks>.}}

===== Features =====


All images are:
  * [[:lazy|lazy loaded]] by default to enhance [[:performance|performance]]
  * ''responsive'' (meaning that they adapt to their container)

===== Supported Image Type =====
''ComboStrap'' supports:
  * [[raster|raster image]]
  * and [[svg|svg image]]
===== Syntax =====

ComboStrap uses:
  * the same syntax than [[doku>wiki:syntax#media_files|Dokuwiki]]
  * extended with the [[styling:styling|styling attributes]]

<code dw>
{{[ ]path?WxH&att=value[ ]}}
</code>
where:
  * ''path'' is:
      * for an internal image: the internal path of the dokuwiki
      * for an external image: the URL.
  * ''W'' is the width (0 = no width defined)
  * ''H'' is the height (Optional)
  * ''[ ]'' are optional spaces that indicates the alignement of the image (left or right)
  * ''att=value'' is one or more [[styling:styling|styling attributes]]



===== Example =====

==== Resize to given width ====

<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
{{:ui:stock_image_surfer_in_the_see.png?200|}}
</code>
</webcode>



<note>
Resizing to a given height is not needed because the image are by default responsive and will adapt to their container. Therefore, this is not supported.
</note>


==== Styling Attributes ====

You can style even further your image with [[styling:styling|styling element]]:
  * with a [[styling:shadow|shadow elevation through styling]].
  * with a [[styling:hover|hover float effect]]

For instance, to elevate this photography with a surfer, you could use this syntax.

<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0>
<code dw>
{{ :ui:stock_image_surfer_in_the_see.png?600&onHover=float&shadow=lg |}}
</code>
</webcode>
