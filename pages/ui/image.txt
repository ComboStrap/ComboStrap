====== ComboStrap UI - Image ======

===== About =====
''image'' is a [[block|block UI Component]] that permits to show images in your pages (media because video are also supported)


===== Articles Related =====
{{backlinks>.}}

===== Syntax =====

ComboStrap uses the same syntax than [[doku>wiki:syntax#media_files|Dokuwiki]]

<code dw>
{{[ ]path?WxH[ ]}}
</code>
where:
  * ''path'' is:
      * for an internal image: the internal path of the dokuwiki
      * for an external image: the URL.
  * ''W'' is the width (0 = no width defined)
  * ''H'' is the height (Optional)
  * ''[ ]'' are optional spaces that indicates the alignement of the image (left or right)



===== Example =====

==== Resize to given width ====
  * Internal image
<code dw>
{{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png?200}}
</code>
  * External Image
<code dw>
{{https://secure.php.net/images/php.gif?200}}
</code>
==== Resize to given width and height ====
  * Internal image
<code dw>
{{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png?200x50}}
</code>
  * External Image
<code dw>
{{https://secure.php.net/images/php.gif?200x50}}
</code>

==== Elevation ====

You can style even further your image with [[styling:styling|styling element]]:
  * with a [[styling:shadow|shadow elevation through styling]].
  * with a [[styling:hover|hover float effect]]

For instance, to elevate this photography with a surfer, you could use this syntax.

<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0>
<code dw>
<box elevation="high" align="center" width="fit-content" onHover="float">
  {{:ui:stock_image_surfer_in_the_see.png?600|}}
</box>
</code>
</webcode>


===== Configuration =====

==== Lazy Loading ====

By default, the images are all loaded:
  * on time: ie just before they will enter the screen (while the user is scrolling)
  * with the lower resolution: the loaded image resolution is based on the screen size with break point at 300, 600 and 900.

If you don't want this feature, you can disable it with the ''lazyLoadRasterImageEnable'' [[:configuration|configuration]].
