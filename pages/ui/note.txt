===== For the Geek =====
''note'' follows the [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/|alert styling of Bootstrap]] but does not follow the [[https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#alert|Alert ARIA Role]] because ''alerts''' are shown as the result of a event (a user action or a notification).

It follows the [[https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#note|Note ARIA Role]]
