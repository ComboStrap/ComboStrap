===== About =====

  * on ''row'' 
  * and ''cell''

===== Syntax =====
<code dw>
<row type>
   <cell vertical="center"></cell>
   <cell></cell>
</row>
</code>
where:
  * ''type'' may be the value:
      * ''auto'' (default) - each cell width will automatically calculated to be greater than the minimum width of ''300''. (This mode will not be applied if a [[styling:dimension|width]] or ''class'' attribute is present)
      * ''natural'' - each cell will takes their natural width and never overflow. Beware that you should set a width on cell with long text because the natural size of text is until the end of the paragraph.
  * ''vertical'': if the value is ''center'', the cell will be vertically centered.
  * and you can use all [[styling:styling|styling attributes]].





===== Example =====

==== Basic two columns ====

The combostrap grid will layout nicely your cells uniformly on the horizontal. They are also readable from the start from a mobile device.

<webcode>
<code dw>
<row spacing="p-5">
    <cell background-color="green" color="white">
        First paragraph in the first cell.
        
        Second paragraph in the first cell.
    </cell>
    <cell background-color="blue" color="white" vertical="center">
        Second cell
     </cell>
</row>
</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>


<note tip>
As you can see, the dimension of the the cells are not uniform, this is why the [[styling:background|background]] is never used inside a grid.
</note>

==== Card with a media ====
You can also use the grid in a [[ui:card|card]] to create all sort of layout.

Example of a card:
  * with an [[ui:image|image]] on the left
  * completly [[styling:clickable|clickable]] 

<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
<card background-color="light" width="800px" align="center">
    <row>
      <cell width="fit" >
        {{:styling:subway_card_tile.png?0x180&align=center|}}
      </cell>
      <cell>
        === Card Clickable Grid ===
        Another instance of placeholder content for this other custom component. It is intended to mimic what some real-world content would look like, and we're using it here to give the component a bit of body and size.
    
        [[#custom_card|Custom card]]
      </cell>
    </row>
</card>
</code>

</webcode>
