====== ComboStrap UI - Tweet ======


===== About =====
A ''tweet'' is not a direct [[ui|UI component]] because it's semantically equivalent to a [[blockquote|blockquote]].

When a [[blockquote|blockquote]] has a tweet URL in its [[cite|cite tag]], the [[blockquote|blockquote]] is considered to be a ''tweet'' and is rendered as such.

===== How to embed a tweet ? =====


==== HTML ====


{{:ui:tweet_embeded_tweet.png|}}

<note>
This step is optional but as ''ComboStrap'' is a [[styling:html|HTML super set language]], the embedded code of twitter is really similar.
</note>

You should get a HTML code that looks like that
<code html>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    The tweet content
    <a href="https://twitter.com/combostrapweb/status/1357699797541601286?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2021</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</code>
As you can see twitter also see an embedded tweet as a quote.

==== Simplified  ====

A [[blockquote|blockquote]] tweet is a simplified version of the [[#get the html tweet|HTML tweet]] where:
  * the ''lang'' and ''dir'' attributes have been placed in the [[blockquote|blockquote component]]
  * the others element have been translated:
     * the ''p'' element has been deleted
     * the ''br'' elements has been replaced by ''%%\\%%''
     * the html link are in a  [[link|link]] format  (ie ''%%[[link]]%%'' without any url has link description)
  * the citation (ie the name and the last [[link|external link]]) has been placed in a [[cite|cite element]].

Example:
<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0>
  * With the [[#get the html tweet|HTML tweet]]
<code dw>
<blockquote lang="en" dir="ltr">
