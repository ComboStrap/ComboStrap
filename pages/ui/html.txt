====== ComboStrap UI - HTML super set ======

===== About =====
The [[:ui:ui|UI ComboStrap components]] are just plugins for the ''HTML'' language.

It means that all HTML attributes are supported and in particularly, you may use
  * the ''class'' (use intensively to set the [[spacing|spacing]])
  * and [[style|style]]
attributes to change the styling.

===== Special Attributes =====

==== Type ====

If a component has a ''type'' attribute, the first attribute is not required to set a name for it.

Example with a [[note|note]], the fully HTML compliant syntax is
<code dw>
<note type="tip">A tip note</note>
</code>
but you can write
<code dw>
<note tip>A tip note</note>
</code>



==== Color ====
The tree [[color|colors attributes]] can be passed natively.


You can write:
<code dw>
<component color="blue">
</code>
in place of 
<code dw>
<component style="color:blue">
</code>
More ... see [[color]]



==== Sizing ====
The Sizing attributes (''width'' and ''height'') are also taken into account in each component.

You can write:
<code dw>
<component width="100px">
</code>


More [[dimension]]
