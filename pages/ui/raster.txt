====== ComboStrap - Raster Images ======


===== About =====
''raster images'' are [[image|image]] that are defined as a matrix of pixel (as opposed to [[svg|vectorial image such as svg that are defined as geometric shape]]).


===== Syntax =====
ComboStrap follows the general [[image#syntax |image syntax]] where you can set:
  * the dimension
  * the alignement
  * and all [[styling:styling|styling attributes]]


==== Example ====

For instance, an [[styling:shadow|elevated]] photography with a surfer and a [[styling:hover|hover float animation]]

<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0>
<code dw>
{{ :ui:stock_image_surfer_in_the_see.png?600&shadow=default&onhover=float |}}
</code>
</webcode>

===== Automatic Resizing =====
With the [[#lazy loading|lazy loading feature]], we detect if the user is on a mobile or a desktop and download the image at the lowest needed resolution.

The loaded image resolution is based on the screen size with the break points at 300, 600 and 900.

===== Configuration =====

==== Lazy Loading ====

By default, the images are all loaded:
  * on time: ie just before they will enter the screen (while the user is scrolling)
  * with the lower resolution: the loaded image resolution is based on the screen size with break point at 300, 600 and 900.

If you don't want this feature, you can disable it with the ''lazyLoadRasterImageEnable'' [[:configuration|configuration]].
