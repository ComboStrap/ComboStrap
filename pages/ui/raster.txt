====== ComboStrap - Raster Images ======


===== About =====
''raster images'' are [[image|image]] that are defined as a matrix of pixel (as opposed to [[svg|vectorial image such as svg that are defined as geometric shape]]).


===== Syntax =====
ComboStrap follows the general [[image#syntax |image syntax]] where you can set:
  * the dimension
  * the alignement
  * and all [[styling:styling|styling attributes]]




For instance, an [[styling:shadow|elevated]] photography with a surfer and a [[styling:hover|hover float animation]]

<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0>
<code dw>
{{ :ui:stock_image_surfer_in_the_see.png?600&shadow=default&onhover=float |}}
</code>
</webcode>

===== Automatic Resizing =====
With the [[#lazy loading|lazy loading feature]], we detect if the user is on a mobile or a desktop and download the image at the lowest needed resolution.

The loaded image resolution is based on the screen size and pixel resolution with breakpoints at 300, 600 and 900.

The below video shows you a demonstration of responsive lazy loading of this page. When we are scrolling, just before the image is shown, we can see at the right side that the image is downloaded at a size of 300px (in the URL)


{{:ui:lazy_responsive_load.gif?600|}}

<note>
If the user has a  mobile with a high pixel ratio resolution such as 3x, the browser will still download the image with a with factor of 3. If you test this feature, be sure to have selected a device pixel ratio of 1 for instance.
</note>

===== Configuration =====

==== Lazy Loading ====

By default, the images are all loaded:
  * on time: ie just before they will enter the screen (while the user is scrolling)
  * with the lower resolution: the loaded image resolution is based on the screen size with break point at 300, 600 and 900.

If you don't want this feature, you can disable it with the ''lazyLoadRasterImageEnable'' [[:configuration|configuration]].
