====== ComboStrap UI - Title ======


===== About =====
A ''title'' is a ''semantic'' [[heading|heading]] that defines the title of a component.

{{backlinks>.}}

===== Syntax =====
The [[sectioning|Dokuwiki Heading syntax]] is supported but if you want more control over the rendering, you can use the ''title'' syntax.

<code dw>
<title type="1" level="1">
Title
</title>
</code>
where:
  * ''type'' is a number from 0 to 4 (Default 0) that defines different display.
  * ''level'' is the heading level (ie in ''h1'', the number 1)


<note>
''title'' is a [[styling:html|Super set HTML component]] and you can then control fully its [[styling:styling|styling]].
</note>

===== Component with a title heading ====

''ComboStrap'' supports a title in the following component:
   * [[card]]
   * [[blockquote]]
   * [[note]]
   * [[jumbotron]]

<note info>This headings are local and does not modify the [[sectioning|structure of the document]]</note>

===== Example =====
<note important>
Even if we not use them inside a component for the simplicity of the below examples, the ''title'' component should be used inside another [[#component_with_a_title_heading|component that accepts a title]].

Otherwise it may be seen by an assistive technologies such as a screen reader as a [[sectioning|sectioning heading]] and will make the page difficult to read for people with visual disability.
