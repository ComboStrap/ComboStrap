====== ComboStrap UI - Preformatted ======


===== About =====
''Preformatted '' is a standard dokuwiki syntax that considers any line that starts with two spaces as a [[doku>wiki:syntax#code_blocks|block of code]].

Due to the hierarchical structure of a document, it makes the reading of a ''Combostrap'' or ''HTML'' document difficult because every element needs to start at the beginning of the line to escape this formatting.

''Combostrap'' disables by default this mode.


===== Demo =====


  * Code
<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0 width=100% scrolling=yes externalResources="," >
<code dw class="no-whitespace-normalization">                A line that starts with a lot of spaces is not seen as a code of block</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>

  
===== Configuration =====

The [[:configuration|configuration]] ''combo>preformattedEnable'' permits to enable or disable this feature.
