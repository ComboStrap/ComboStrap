==== Disable the already included extensions ====
<note warning>
If you have already one of this extension:
  * [[doku>plugin:404manager]]
  * [[doku>plugin:webcomponent]]
you need to disable them because they are already included in this installation.

  * And click the disable button (or uninstall)
