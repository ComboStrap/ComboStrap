====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Title ======

===== About =====

''ComboStrap'' can manage the meta ''title'' of a web page.

A page's title may be a few words or a phrase (whereas a [[description|page's description]] might be a sentence or two or even a short paragraph. 

This ''title'' will:
  * show up in the [[#Search Engine Result Pages (SERP)]]
  * show up in the title bar at the top of the web browser, 
  * show up in social cards such as [[twitter|twitter]] or [[facebook|facebook]]
  * be used when someone bookmarks the page.
  * be used in ''text-to-speech (TTS)'' (thanks to [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/speakable|Speakable]])

===== Processing =====

==== With Dokuwiki ====

For [[doku>|Dokuwiki]], 
  * by default, the title of a page is the [[doku>pagename|DokuWiki Id]] with the the [[doku>config:title|title configuration]]
  * If the [[doku>config:useheading|useheading]] [[:configuration|configuration]] is on, the first [[docs:content:heading|heading]] is used to replace the [[doku>pagename|DokuWiki Id]]

==== With ComboStrap ====
<note warning>
The [[:strap|Strap template]] is mandatory or a template should take into account the ''title'' metadata.
</note>

With [[:start|ComboStrap]], if you set a ''title'' property with [[frontmatter|frontmatter]], it will become the page title.

Example:
<code javascript>
---json
{
    "title":"Page title (Set by Combostrap)"
}
---
</code>
Result:
{{:semantic:page_title_set_by_combostrap.png|}}
    



<note>
With the [[:strap|strap template]],  the website ''home page'' title is the Dokuwiki title with the website [[semantic:tagline|tagline]] 
</note>

===== Search Engine Result Pages (SERP) =====

The title is used in the [[kb>serp|Search Engine Result Pages (SERP)]] (ie the results that you see when querying Google) where it appear in the first line of the results.

  * ''Accurate'' (that describe the page's content)
