====== ComboStrap - Identity Management ======


===== About =====
''identity management'' is based on the [[doku>acl|Dokuwiki Acl module and plugins]]. 



''ComboStrap'' add styling to the identity forms:
  * [[#login]]
  * [[#registration]]
  * and [[#resend Password]]

==== Login ====

The [[doku>login]] form shows:
  * a username
  * a password
  * and an ''remember me'' check box if the [[doku>config:rememberme|rememberme configuration]] is equal to one.

==== Registration ====

The [[doku>login#registration|Registration form]] will shows:
  * a username
  * a password and its confirmation (if the [[doku>config:autopasswd|automatic password feature]] is not enabled)
  * a real name 
  * and an email field

==== Resend Password ====

The ''resend password'' will shows only one field, the username.

==== Profile ====

[[doku>config:profileconfirm]] - Require a user to confirm their current password when updating their DokuWiki user profile.
===== Configuration =====

==== Logo ====
The ''enableLogoOnIdentityForms'' permits to enable or disable the rendering of the [[getting_started:4_favicon|logo]] on the header of the forms.

==== Enable / Disable Forms ====
All forms are disabled, if the [[doku>acl|acl module]] is disabled.

You can also if you want to get back to the original forms, disable the rendering of the forms individually with the following [[configuration|configuration]]:
  * ''enableLoginForm''
  * ''enableRegistrationForm''
  * ''enableResendPwdForm''
