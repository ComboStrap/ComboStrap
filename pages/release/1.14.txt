===== About =====
The ''release 1.14'' has made Combostap fully functional on the [[styling:typo|typographic side]]. It was needed to create ''landing page'' that requires to tweak the style a little bit.

There is also a lot of improvement in order to make the product easier to use.

  * New: the [[styling:opacity|opacity attribute]] has its own page and can be applied to all component (not only to [[styling:background|background]])

  * New: an internal link can be [[ui:link#styling|styled]]
  * <itext color=danger>New !</itext>: added the text specialized colors for the [[ui:text#color|text]] and [[ui:itext#color|itext]] component.


==== Page Layout: Landing Page ====
  * New [[strap:layout|page layout]]: ''landing'' in order to create landing page with section of page created with the [[ui:slide|slide component]]

==== Markdown Code Syntax ====
  * new: The [[ui:code|code]] component supports also the [[ui:code#markdown|markdown github code syntax]]

==== Markdown Heading ====
The [[ui:heading|heading component]] supports also the ATX markdown heading.



==== Print ====
[[styling:print|print]]. The lazy loaded image are downloaded before print and the bars are cached to be able to print a page.
==== Outline Numbering ====
[[ui:outline#numbering|Outline Numbering]] is now fully customizable from decimal to latin-upper. Due to this change, the anchor are now located to the right and this is no more mandatory to use the [[ui:renderer|renderer]]

==== New Statistics on component usage ====
You can now analyse the syntax used in your page with the [[analytics:statistics#syntax_count|syntax count]] analytics.

==== RTL and Component Language support ====
  * New: support for RTL language at the page level, through the [[semantic:lang|lang metadata of frontmatter]], we apply now the right language and direction in the [[strap:strap|strap template]]. Example: [[semantic:lang_ar]]
  * New: [[semantic:lang|Lang attribute]] to mix languages on the same page. Demo with English and Arabic languages: [[semantic:lang_ar]]

==== Credits page added  ====
  * Added the [[:credits|credits page]]

===== Improvement =====

==== Heading ====
You can now style the content of your [[ui:heading|heading]] (adding icon, boldness, ...)
==== Note ====
  * The [[ui:note|note component]] got also the [[styling:userstyle#class|userstyle class]].
  * A [[ui:note|note]] does not have any extra bottom margin. Due to the last paragraph of a [[ui:note|note]] and the default stylesheet of the browser, the content was not centered vertically.

==== Link ====
The [[ui:link|link attribute]] can now be used with the [[styling:styling|styling attributes]]
==== Slide ====
The [[ui:slide|slide component]] gets responsive x margin. Using more left and right margins, the bigger the screen is.
==== Icon ====
  * The [[ui:icon|icon component]] accepts any length unit (such as rem) and [[styling:spacing|padding]] was disabled because it makes the icon invisible.
  * The icon attached to the configuration is no more downloaded but included to the page and cached leading to a big performance gain.
==== HTML Super set ====
In [[styling:html|html super set language]], this is no more needed for an attribute:
      * to set a value if the value is true, 
      * to enclose the value between between quotes if the value does not contain any spaces.
==== Webcode ====
  * [[ui:webcode|webcode]] shows the example code in a iframe. The markup code does not conflict with the code of the page. This was needed for the [[ui:heading|heading example]].
  * [[ui:webcode|webcode]] supports also the markdown code syntax
==== Clickable ====
  * [[styling:clickable|clickable]] can now be used in **all** components with a link. This is no more limited to [[ui:grid|grid]] and [[ui:card|card]].

==== A bootstrap template is no more mandatory ====
Every template perfect: A bootstrap and [[strap:strap|strap]] template is no longer mandatory. If [[strap:bootstrap|Bootstrap]] is not found, it will be added. The css of the template may conflict. This is the case for instance with the default Dokuwiki. In a button, this template sets the color of ''a:link'' and ''a:visited'' that takes precedence over the white text color and the text in the button is therefore not displayed. You need then to set the [[styling:color|text color]] to ''white'' for each primary button.

==== Brand ====
[[ui:brand|brand]] is now a [[styling:html|superset html component]] and allows all styling.

==== Grid ====

  * New: The ''automatic'' [[ui:grid|grid]] type. With this mode, the width of each column is automatically set and there is never an overflow on low screen size
  * The first paragraph of a [[ui:grid|grid]] does not touch the border anymore. The default stylesheet of the browser gave a zero margin and we corrected that.

===== Modification =====

==== Link ====
  * Modification Strap Css: The links are not anymore without underlined as specified in the [[https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/blob/stable/lib/tpl/dokuwiki/css/basic.less#L200|default dokuwiki template]]. This is just not the default of Bootstrap as seen in the [[https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_variables.scss#L289|default of the reboot stylesheet]].

==== Grid ====
  * The ''col'' tag of the [[ui:grid|grid]] is now known as ''cell'' which makes much more sense as you can have several cell that  on several line.
==== Bar becomes slot ====
  * To not confound with the ''bar'' term as ui component, the ''bar'' of the strap template has been renamed to [[strap:slot|slot]]

==== Navbar becomes menubar ====
The ''navbar'' has also be renamed to [[ui:menubar|menu bar]] that convey much more it's functionality (being an horizontal bar with dropdown).

==== Title and Heading are known as heading ====
The ''title'' component is now integrated and known as a [[ui:heading|heading]]. No more difference, the context choose if this is an heading for an outline or not.

===== Bug =====
==== Webcode ====
When the content of a rendered [[ui:webcode|webcode]] is less than the default html element height of 150, the padding of the first descendant phrasing element would end up in the margin of the iframe html element. 

==== Target for internal link was not taken into account ====
Bug: [[doku>config:target|target]] configuration was not taken into account for [[ui:link|internal link]]


==== Frontmatter section editing ====

  * Bug: edit section on [[semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]] had a bad end position due to variable mismatch.



==== Box ====

  * [[ui:box|box]] does not delete paragraphs anymore (ie has become a stack component)

==== Link ====

  * Bug: A [[ui:link|link]] without description but with a separator was showing nothing. This is corrected and we get now the default page description.



==== Collapse ====
The new [[release:1.13_bootstrap5|bootstrap]] namespace was not applied and therefore [[ui:collapse|collapse]] was not working with Bootstrap 5.
===== Deprecated =====
==== Dynamic Grid ====

  * [[release:deprecated:dynamic_grid|grid of 16 (dynamic grid)]] is deprecated from Bootstrap 5
==== Title ====

The ''title'' component is now integrated and known as a [[ui:heading|heading]]. No more difference, the context choose if this is an heading for an outline or not.

==== Navbar ====
The ''navbar'' has been renamed to [[ui:menubar|menubar]] that convey much more it's functionality (being an horizontal bar with dropdown).

==== Typo is no known as text ====

  * Change: The ''typo'' component has been renamed to [[ui:text|text]]
