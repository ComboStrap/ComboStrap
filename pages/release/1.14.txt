====== Release 1.14 - Snapshot ======


===== Change List =====

==== Landing Page ====
  * New [[strap:layout|page layout]]: ''landing'' in order to create landing page with section of page created with the [[ui:slide|slide component]]

==== Markdown ====
  * new: The [[ui:code|code]] component supports also the [[ui:code#markdown|markdown github code syntax]]
==== Miscellaneous ====
  * Improvement: The [[ui:note|note component]] got also the [[styling:userstyle#class|userstyle class]].
  * Improvement: The [[ui:link|link attribute]] can now be used with the [[styling:styling|styling attributes]]
  * Improvement: The [[ui:slide|slide component]] gets responsive x margin. Using more left and right margins, the bigger the screen is.
  * Improvement: The [[ui:icon|icon component]] accepts any length unit (such as rem) and [[styling:spacing|padding]] was disabled because it makes the icon invisible.
  * Improvement: in [[styling:html|html super set language]], this is no more needed for an attribute:
      * to set a value if the value is true, 
      * to enclose the value between between quotes if the value does not contain any spaces.
  * Modification Strap Css: The links are not anymore without underlined as specified in the [[https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/blob/stable/lib/tpl/dokuwiki/css/basic.less#L200|default dokuwiki template]]. This is just not the default of Bootstrap as seen in the [[https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_variables.scss#L289|default of the reboot stylesheet]].
  * New: [[ui:webcode|webcode]] shows the example code in a iframe. The markup code does not conflict with the code of the page. This was needed for the heading.


==== New Statistics ====
You can now analyse the syntax used in your page with the [[analytics:statistics#syntax_count|syntax count]] analytics.

==== RTL language ====
  * New: support for RTL language at the page level, through the [[semantic:lang|lang metadata of frontmatter]], we apply now the right language and direction in the [[strap:strap|strap template]]. Example: [[semantic:lang_ar]]
  * New: [[semantic:lang|Lang attribute]] to mix languages on the same page. Demo with English and Arabic languages: [[semantic:lang_ar]]

==== Grid ====

  * New: The ''automatic'' [[ui:grid|grid]] type. With this mode, the width of each column is automatically set and there is never an overflow on low screen size
  * The first paragraph of a [[ui:grid|grid]] does not touch the border anymore. The default stylesheet of the browser gave a zero margin and we corrected that.
==== Typography ====
  * New [[styling:typo|typographic page]]
  * Change: The ''typo'' component has been renamed to [[ui:text|text]]
  * New: the [[ui:text|text component]] accepts to style several paragraph at once
  * New: the [[ui:itext|itext component]] accepts to style several characters / words at once (i for [[ui:inline|inline]])
  * New: the [[ui:text|text component]] accepts to a [[ui:text#line-spacing|line-spacing attribute]] to set the height between each line of a paragraph
  * New: the [[styling:text-align|text-align]] attribute can now be conditional and takes the start and end notation
  * New: the [[styling:opacity|opacity attribute]] has its own page and can be applied to all component (not only to [[styling:background|background]])
  * New: the [[styling:boldness|boldness attribute]] to set the font-weight from extra-light to extra-dark.
  * New: the [[styling:line-spacing|line spacing attribute]] to set the space between line
  * New: the [[styling:font-size|font size attribute]] to set the size of characters
  * New page: the color of the text got a page: [[styling:text-color]]
  * New [[:styling:color#reset|color value ''reset'']]: the reset color permits to takes the color of its parent.
  * New: the underline effect can be set with the [[styling:underline|underline attribute]]
  * New: an internal link can be [[ui:link#styling|styled]]
  * <itext color=danger>New !</itext>: added the text specialized colors for the [[ui:text#color|text]] and [[ui:itext#color|itext]] component.


==== Bug Solved ====

  * [[ui:box|box]] does not delete paragraphs anymore (ie has become a stack component)
  * Bug: A [[ui:link|link]] without description but with a separator was showing nothing. This is corrected and we get now the default page description.

==== Markup perfect ====
  * A [[ui:note|note]] does not have any extra bottom margin. Due to the last paragraph of a [[ui:note|note]] and the default stylesheet of the browser, the content was not centered vertically.
  * The first paragraph of a [[ui:grid|grid]] does not touch the border anymore. The default stylesheet of the browser gave a zero margin and we corrected that.

==== Documentation ====
  * Added the [[:credits|credits page]]

==== Deprecated ====
  * [[release:deprecated:dynamic_grid|grid of 16 (dynamic grid)]] is deprecated from Bootstrap 5
