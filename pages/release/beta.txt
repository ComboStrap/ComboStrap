==== Markdown Page Extension ====

Actually, there is no way to change the file extension of a page.

This is possible to change it at write/read but the [[https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/blob/master/inc/pageutils.php#L292|wikiFN]] function
that makes the translation between a ID and a file does not allow it.


A simple modification such as the below in the[[https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/blob/master/inc/pageutils.php#L307|wikiFn function]] works for writing / editing a file (The history functionality was not tested).
<code php>
if ($id == "markdown"){
        $ext = 'md';
} else {
        $ext = 'txt';
}

if(empty($rev)){
    $fn = $conf['datadir'].'/'.utf8_encodeFN($id).'.'.$ext;
}else{
   $fn = $conf['olddir'].'/'.utf8_encodeFN($id).'.'.$rev.'.'.$ext;
   ....
}
