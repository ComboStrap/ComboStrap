====== ComboStrap - Release 1.17 ======


===== About =====

===== List =====
  * The [[:identity|identity forms]] ''update profile'' and ''delete profile'' are now also styled.
  * [[styling:align|align]] understand now ''start'' and ''end'' to make page [[semantic:lang##rtlright_to_left_language|LTR or RTL language ready]].
  * Improvement: Added the page on the error message. The error messages may be created in the background and are then not always relevant to the actual page. 
  * [[:frontend_optimization|FrontEnd Optimization]]:
      * ComboStrap is no more dependent on Jquery
      * New: Disable backend Javascript
  * Improvement [[ui:svg|SVG]]
      * A transparent gif is shown when lazy loaded
      * [[ui:svg#svginjectionenable|Svg Injection]] has been disabled by default because we may see on slow network a blank image.
