====== ComboStrap - Release 1.17 ======


===== About =====

===== List =====
  * The [[:identity|identity forms]] ''update profile'' and ''delete profile'' are now also styled.
  * [[styling:align|align]] understand now ''start'' and ''end'' to make page [[semantic:lang##rtlright_to_left_language|LTR or RTL language ready]].
  * Improvement: Added the page on the error message. The error messages may be created in the background and are then not always relevant to the actual page. 
  * [[:frontend_optimization|FrontEnd Optimization]]:
      * ComboStrap is no more dependent on Jquery
      * New: Disable backend Javascript
  * Improvement [[ui:svg|SVG]]
      * A placeholder is shown with the good dimension when lazy loaded
      * [[ui:svg#svginjectionenable|Svg Injection]] was showing a broken image for a couple of second. This is because the underlying library let a src with no value. We just cache the image before the injection and show it again after.
  * new [[ui:pipeline|Pipeline function]]: ''cut'' and ''trim''
  * Bug: [[:lazy|Lazy loaded image]] has a transparent inline gif image placeholder that has an intrinsic dimension of 1x1 creating problem and layout shift when the image are responsive.
  * Bug: [[ui:card_column|card-column layout]] in Bootstrap 5 is implemented via Masonry and a recalculation of the layout should be done after each image load.
  * Bug: As [[ui:image|image]] crop is not supported, a warning message was shown and we didn't let the original code take over. Crop are now supported via the original code.
  * Bug: [[ui:heading|heading]] in [[ui:webcode|webcode]] were seen as component heading and not as outline heading.
