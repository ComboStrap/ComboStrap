==== Markup perfect ====
Markup perfect means that there is no need to tweak the output via styling.

  * New: Template Protection: We empty the php buffer before printing and send a message to admin user. Otherwise, plugins that print directly may mess the page completely.
  * Improvement: For boolean attributes such as ''selected'' for a [[ui:tabs|panel tab]], this is no more needed to specify the value. ie ''selected'' is equivalent to ''selected=true''
  * Improvement: A [[ui:note|note]] is now markup perfect (a stack) and accepts paragraph inside
  * New: [[styling:float|floating right]] will add a margin at the left.


==== Bug ====

  * Bug: A [[ui:link#image|image link]] points to the page now and not to the image.
  * Bug: Backlinks are now correctly rewritten when moving a page. The backlinks that were not in first position were be badly rewritten from ''%%[[id|description]]%%'' to ''%%[[newid]]|description]]%%''
