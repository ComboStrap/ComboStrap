===== About =====
''css optimization'' is a [[:start|ComboStrap]] module that reduce the CSS overhead when a public user is navigating the website and speeds therefore the ''page rendering''.

===== The goal =====

''ComboStrap'' is build only around:
  * the [[strap:bootstrap|BootStrap CSS file]].
  * and web components (ie the CSS is embedded in the page only when the component is used).

As the [[strap:bootstrap|BootStrap file]] is distributed worldwide thanks to the Content delivery network, it reaches the computer user really quickly. 

Because we embrace the web component technology, we add to the page only the CSS needed to render for each component to render. 

The page speed is then completely dependent on where your server is located.

<note tip>
If you [[doku>plugin:siteexport|generate the pages statically]] and store them also from a Content delivery network, the speed is optimal.

By default, this optimization is disabled.

You can enable it by changing the ''enableMinimalFrontEndCss'' [[:configuration|configuration]]



==== Disable the Dokuwiki Stylesheet ====

<note tip>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/lib/exe/css.php?t=dokuwiki&tseed=xxxxxx">
</code>
</note>

==== Enable Preload ====

<note warning>
We don't recommend to enable css preload because even if the rendering of your page will be faster, the page rendering will [[wp>Flash_of_unstyled_content|flikker]] if the network is slow.
</note>

''preloadCss'' is a [[strap:strap|strap template]] configuration that enables [[https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/resource-prioritization#preload|Css preloading]].
