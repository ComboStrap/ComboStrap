====== BootStrap 5 Migration ======


===== About =====
[[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/|BootStrap 5]] on Combostrap is a work in progress.


===== Changes =====

==== Deleted but preserved ====
  * [[ui:card_column|Card Columns]] was deleted from Bootstrap 4 but we maintain it as explained in this [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/masonry/|example]]
  * [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/javascript/#still-want-to-use-jquery-its-possible|Jquery is no more a dependency for Bootstrap]]. 

==== Modified but preserved ====

  * ''color'' names have now the [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/css-variables/|prefix ''bs'']]. We maintain the old color scheme without the prefix name by applying the prefix transparently.
  * ''auto margin'' used in the [[ui:group|Navgroup]] with the ''expand'' attribute has been renamed from [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/#auto-margins|mr-auto]] to [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/flex/#auto-margins|me-auto]].

==== Modified not preserved ====
  * If you made use of utility directly from bootstrap with the [[styling:class|class attribute]] not using the [[styling:spacing|spacing utility]] for instance), they have been [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/migration/#utilities-2|renamed]] and we can't do much.

The left and right spacing utility have been renamed to support text direction.
  * in place of ''l'', you get a ''s'' - for classes that set margin-left or padding-left in LTR, margin-right or padding-right in RTL
  * in place of ''r'', you get a ''e'' - for classes that set margin-right or padding-right in LTR, margin-left or padding-left in RTL
