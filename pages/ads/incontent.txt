==== Enable the IncontentAds module ====
The [[#AdsIncontentEnable]] configuration toggle on and off the use of this module.

By default, the value is ''off'', you need to set it ''on''

==== Create your ads ====
At this point, no ads is shown because no ads have been created.

''Ads'' are just ''page'' that contains the Ads snippet that define the [[kb>ad/unit|ad unit]] (ie the ad location and format)


The Ads pages are expected to be on this location:
<code>
combostrap:ads:incontentX
</code>
where X is the Ads number in the page and starts at 1.

For instance:
  * the page ''combostrap:ads:incontent1'' will contain the first inContent ad.
  * the page ''combostrap:ads:incontent2'' will contain the second inContent ad.
