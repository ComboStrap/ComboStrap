===== Example =====

For instance, if you want to add a ''Ad'' in the top of the [[strap:sidebor|sidebar]], you would:
  * create a [[page|ad page]] called ''sidebarTop'' 
  * and add it in your [[strap:sidebor|sidebar]] with the following syntax
<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0 width=100% scrolling=yes externalResources="," renderingMode=story >
<code dw>
<ad name="sidebarTop"/>
</code>

</webcode>





===== Syntax =====

<code syntax>
<ad name="adsFileName"/>
</code>
where ''adsFileName'' is the name of the [[page|ad page]].

<note info>
The ''ad'' component is a [[styling:html|superset HTML component]] and you can style it as you want.
</note>

<note warning>
Because the ''ads'' are stored as page, they are by default added to the index.

You need to set a configuration to prevent it. See [[conf]]
