==== Enable the In-Article Ads module ====
The [[#AdsInArticleEnable]] configuration toggle on and off the use of this module.

By default, the value is ''off'', you need to set it ''on''

==== Create your ads ====
At this point, no ads is shown because no ''ads'' have been created.

To show ''in-article ads'', you need to create [[page|Ads pages]] that follow this naming convention.
<code>
inarticleX
</code>
where X is the Ads number in the page and starts at 1.

For instance:
  * the [[page|ad page]] ''inarticle1'' will contain the first ''in-article ad''.
  * the [[page|ad page]] ''inarticle2'' will contain the second ''in-article ad''.
