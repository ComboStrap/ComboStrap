====== ComboStrap - Perfomance ======

===== About =====
''performance'' is how fast your page will be seen by your user from the moment they click on a link and shows the resulting page.


Google has a most detailed definition of what performance is and gives you with its 



===== Steps =====

==== Stylesheet ====
The size of a web page served to the public (user not logged in) can be optimized with the [[:css|CSS optimization module]]

All [[styling:stylesheet|published stylesheet (bootstrap and bootswatch)]] are served by defaut from a [[strap:cdn|CDN]]

If you are using only ComboStrap, you can even disable the Dokuwiki Stylesheet for public user with the [[:css#disableDokuwikiStylesheet|disableDokuwikiStylesheet configuration]]

The stylesheet used for [[styling:animation|animation]] are loaded at the end of the page.

==== Javascript ====
By default, the [[strap:bootstrap|bootstrap files]] are served from a [[strap:cdn|CDN]] and are deferred.

==== Cache Bursting ====
The [[:cache|sidebar cache]] is automatically bursted and is therefore rendered only when needed and not for every page.


[[strap:sidebor|Sidebars]] are using heavily the index when they show [[ui:navigation|navigation component]] and have a great impact on the web server rendering time.

With the cache bursting, the only user impacted is the editor that is recreating the sidebar when he saves the page.

==== Image ====
=== Lazy load ===

All images are [[lazy|lazy loaded]] by default. It means that they are loaded only when are on the screen or are going to enter in the screen.

=== Automatic sizing ===

All raster images (jpg, png, ...) are also automatically loaded with the appropriate sizing. 

If a page contains an big image (say 1200px),  this image will be resized to 300px on a mobile screen.
