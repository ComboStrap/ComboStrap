====== ComboStrap - Automatic Cache Bursting ======


===== About =====
The ''sidebars'' cache ([[strap:sidebor|sidebar]] or [[strap:sidekickbor|sidekickbar]]) are automatically deleted when a page is:
  * modified, 
  * added 
  * or deleted
in the same namespace (directory).

===== Why ? =====

As the ''sidebars'' reflects a namespace by having [[ui:navigation|navigational elements]] such as a [[ui:ntoc|ntoc]]:
  * their content becomes generally stale when a page is modified, added or deleted. 
  * they have an important impact on [[:performance|performance]] because they read the index.

''ComboStrap'' takes care of it and deletes automatically the ''sidebars'' cache when it happens.
