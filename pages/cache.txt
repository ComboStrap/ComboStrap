====== ComboStrap - Automatic Cache Bursting ======


===== About =====
The ''sidebars'' cache ([[strap:sidebor|sidebar]] or [[strap:sidekickbor|sidekickbar]]) is automatically deleted when a page is modified, added or deleted from a namespace.

===== Why ? =====

As the ''sidebars'' reflects a namespace by having navigational element such as a [[ui:ntoc|ntoc]], there content becomes generally stale when a page is modified, added or deleted. 

''ComboStrap'' takes care of it and deletes automatically the ''sidebars'' cache when it happens.
