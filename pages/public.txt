====== ComboStrap - Public Front End Optimization ======


===== About =====
''public front end optimization'' is a [[:start|ComboStrap]] module that reduce the page overhead when a ''public'' / ''anonymous'' / ''search engine'' user is navigating your website and speeds therefore the performance of the ''page rendering''.

{{backlinks>.}}

===== The goal =====

''ComboStrap'' is build only around:
  * the [[strap:bootstrap|BootStrap CSS file]].
  * and web components (ie the CSS is embedded in the page only when the component is used).

As the [[strap:bootstrap|BootStrap file]] is distributed worldwide thanks to the Content delivery network, it reaches the computer user really quickly. 

Because we embrace the web component technology, we add to the page only the CSS needed for each component to render. 

The page speed is then completely dependent on where your server is located.

<note tip>
If you [[doku>plugin:siteexport|generate the pages statically]] and store them also from a Content delivery network, the speed is optimal.
</note>

===== Optimization and Configuration =====

==== Enable Minimization ====
Minimization reduce the size of the Dokuwiki CSS file by removing the styling of backend plugin.

By default, this optimization is disabled.

You can enable it by changing the ''enableMinimalFrontEndCss'' [[:configuration|configuration]]



==== Disable the Dokuwiki Stylesheet ====
If your front-end is completely based on ''ComboStrap'', you don't need to include the Dokuwiki Stylesheet file for anonymous user.


By default, this optimization is disabled.

You can enable it by changing the ''disableDokuwikiStylesheet'' [[:configuration|configuration]]

<note tip>
=== For the geek ===

This optimization will delete from the front end page, the following HTML header
<code html>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/lib/exe/css.php?t=dokuwiki&tseed=xxxxxx">
</code>
</note>

==== Disable third Javascript ====

If your front-end is completely based on ''ComboStrap'', you don't need to include third Javascript files that are used only for the backend. 

This configuration goes even further with [[strap:bootstrap|bootstrap version 5]] and delete [[strap:jquery|Jquery]].

<note important>
If you use any analytics plugin such as the Google Analytics that relies on Javascript, you should not use/check this option.
</note>

If the configuration ''disableThirdJavascriptForPublicUser'' is checked, the following javascript script will not be included in your pages:
  * ''js.php''
  * ''jquery.php'' (only for Bootstrap 5)
  * ''JSINFO''




==== Enable Preload ====

<note warning>
We don't recommend to enable css preload because even if the rendering of your page will be faster, the page rendering will [[wp>Flash_of_unstyled_content|flikker]] if the network is slow.
</note>

''preloadCss'' is a [[strap:strap|strap template]] configuration that enables [[https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/resource-prioritization#preload|Css preloading]].
