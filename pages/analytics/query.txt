You can try the below query that returns statistics over ''words'' from the [[data|json analytics column]].
<code sql>
select
	count(*) as page_count,
	round(avg(words)) as words_avg,
	sum(words) as words_count,
	max(words) as words_max,
	min(words) as words_min
from
	(
	select
		id,
		json_extract(analytics , '$.statistics.words') as words
	from
		pages
	where
		analytics is not null
)
</code>
