====== ComboStrap Analytics - Page Statistics ======


===== About =====
The ''ComboStrap Page Statistics'' are a list of ''page statistics'' that are available in the [[data|analytical data]].


===== Example Words Summary =====
For instance, if you want to get statistics over ''words'', you could [[query|execute]] the below query.
<code sql>
select
	count(*) as page_count,
	round(avg(words)) as words_avg,
	sum(words) as words_count,
	max(words) as words_max,
	min(words) as words_min
from
	(
	select
		id,
		json_extract(analytics, '$.statistics.words') as words
	from
		pages
	where
		analytics is not null 
)
</code>

And this is the result that we get on this website.
