  * [[semantic:semantic|metadata]]: the metadata 
  * [[statistics|statistics]] : page statistics such as words_count, links, header
  * [[quality:quality|quality]] data:
      * ''low'' is the [[quality:low_quality_page|low quality page]] indicator
      * ''quality score'' data
      * [[quality:rule|quality rule information]]

<code sql >
select
	id,
	json_extract(analytics,'$.quality.failed_mandatory_rules') as failed_rules,
	json_extract(analytics,'$.statistics.words_count') as words,
	json_extract(analytics,'$.statistics.internal_links_count') as internal_links,
	json_extract(analytics,'$.statistics.internal_backlinks_count') as internal_backlinks
from
	pages
