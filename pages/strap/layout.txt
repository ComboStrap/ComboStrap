====== Strap - Page Layout ======

===== About =====

ComboStrap supports actually, three page layouts:
  * [[#holy]] - the default
  * [[#median]] - the main content is centered and does not take the space of the sidebar if not present.
  * [[#landing]] - the main content is not centered and takes the full page width


===== List =====


==== Holy ====

The default layout is a fully responsive layout (known also as the ''holy grail'') with:
  * a [[strap:header_slot|header slot]]
  * a [[strap:footer_slot|footer slot]]
  * and three columns:
      * [[strap:side_slot|left slot]]
      * [[strap:sidekickbor|right slot]]
      * main content

They are all [[ui:container|contained]] in a page that is:
  * centered 
  * with a width adjusted by screen size (by breakpoint)

The main content width expands to the width of the page if the sidebars are not present.

==== Median ====

If there is no sidebars, the median layout centers the main content with a fix width, making the length of a line shorter and therefore more readable.


You can defined it with the following [[semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]]
<code json>
{
   "layout":"median"
}
</code>


==== Landing ====

In a landing page layout, the main content is not [[ui:container|contained]].

You can then create section of page with the [[ui:slide|slide component]] where the [[styling:background|background]] will take the whole width of the page.


You can defined it with the following [[semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]]
<code json>
{
   "layout":"landing"
}
</code>

Then in your [[ui:slide|slide]] component, you can still center the content by adding a [[ui:container|container]].
<code dw>
<slide size="lg">
    <background color="light"></background>
    <container>
        ... Your content
    </container>
</slide>
</code>
