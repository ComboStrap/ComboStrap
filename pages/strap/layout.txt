===== About =====


Layout are important.

{{:strap:layout_funny.png|}}

You can specify a layout by page


===== List =====


==== Default ====

The default layout is a fully responsive layout (known also as the holy grail) with:
  * a [[strap:headerbor|header]]
  * a [[strap:footerbor|footer]]
  * and three columns:
      * [[strap:sidebor|left sidebar]]
      * [[strap:sidekickbor|right sidebar]]
      * main content

They are all contained in a page that is:
  * centered 
  * with a width adjusted by screen size (by breakpoint)

The main content width expands to the width of the page if the sidebars are not present.

==== Median ====

If there is no sidebars, the median layout centers the main content with a fix width.


You can defined it with the following [[semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]]
<code json>
{
   "layout":"median"
}
