===== Configuration =====

==== Grid size ====
The default grid system of [[bootstrap|bootstrap]] is based on ''12 columns'' and does not really allow any space for a [[sidekickbor|second sidebar]]

''strap'' supports a ''16 columns'' grid.

To change the grid size, set the following [[:configuration|configuration]]:
  * The ''gridColumns'' number to ''16''.
  * The [[styling:stylesheet|Stylesheet]] to ''bootstrap.16col.min.css''

<note important>
=== Be careful ===
''Strap'' is not controlling this values. If you choose a 16 grid with a bootstrap stylesheet of 12 columns, you may got unwanted behavior.
</note>

<note info>
=== For the geek ===
The 16 columns stylesheet set:
  *  the xl breakpoint from ''1200px'' to ''1280px''.
  * the [[ui:container|container]] max width for the xl breakpoint from ''1140px'' to ''1280px''.
See [[styling:breakpoint]]
</note>

==== Size of the sidebars ====
The sidebars (''sidebar'' and [[sidekickbor|sidekickbar]]) have now a fixed weight of 3 columns.

<badge>To be able to change this weight dynamically is planned for the [[release:release|version 1.3]]</badge>
