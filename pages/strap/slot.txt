====== Strap Template - Slot ======


===== About =====
''slot'' are placeholders in the template that can be filled by creat

The Strap template supports the following slot:
  * [[side_slot|side slot]] (at the left side of the content)
  * [[header_slot|header slot]] (at the top of a page)
  * [[footer_slot|footer slot]] (at the bottom of a page)
  * [[sidekickbor|sidekick slot]] (at the right of the content)


For instance:
  * if you want to fill the [[side_slot|side slot]] for the whole website, you would create the ''side slot'' page (by default known as ''sidebar'')
  * if you want to fill the [[side_slot|side slot]] only  for a specific ''namespace'', you would create the  ''side slot'' page under this namespace (for instance: ''namespace:sidebar'')

  * A ''slot'' is automatically [[quality:automatic_hidden|hidden]] and not searchable.
  * [[:sideslots|Side slots (side and sidekick slots)]] are rendered for every namespace and regenerated for each namespace changes (page creation, modification, deletion)
