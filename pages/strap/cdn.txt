====== Strap - CDN ======


===== About =====
''cdn'' is a feature that permits to serve the [[bootstrap|bootstrap]] static files for anonymous users from a ''CDN''.

<note>
=== Why only for anonymous user ?===

This feature is only available for the front end (ie anonymous user) because power users such as managers, writers and admins may use plugins that requires the full dokuwiki interactive functionalities such as Jquery-ui.

The performance gain and the advantages for this power users are also minimal because as they use heavily the website, the first page may take a couple of second more to load but the cache kicks in and the subsequent pages render really fast.
