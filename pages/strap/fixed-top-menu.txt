===== Features =====

A ''fixed-top'' [[ui:menubar|menu bar]] gives a great experience but is difficult to implement because they needs some extra styling in order to relocate:
  * the top location of the page
  * the location of the [[ui:heading|heading]]
Without this changements, a navigation via a link to an [[ui:heading|heading]] would land below the fixed-top menu and will then cache the heading.

''ComboStrap'' is ''fixed-top menu'' ready and permits to implement it with a couple of parameters. See the [[#how_to_configure_a_fixed-top_menu|steps]]
