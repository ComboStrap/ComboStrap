====== Strap Template - Bar ======


===== About =====
''bar'' are placeholders in the template that can be filled dynamically.

The Strap template supports now the following bar:
  * [[sidebor|sidebar]] (at the left side)
  * [[headerbor|headerbar]] (at the top)
  * [[footerbor|footerbar]] (at the bottom)
  * [[sidekickbor|sidekickbar]] (at the right)


For instance:
  * if you want to create a [[sidebor|sidebar]] for the whole website, you would create the page called ''sidebar''
  * if you want to create a [[sidebor|sidebar]] specific for a ''namespace'', you would create the page called ''namespace:sidebar''

  * All ''bar'' follows the same convention than  a [[doku>faq:sidebar|sidebar]]
  * A ''bar'' can defined by namespace (directory), if there is a ''bar'' page created in a namespace, this bar has a higher priority than the root bar and is rendered for this namespace.
  * A ''bar'' is automatically [[seo:automatic_hidden|hidden]].
