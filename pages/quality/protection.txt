====== Page - Protection Mode ======

===== About =====
The ''protection mode'' is a [[:configuration|configuration]] value that determine how articles that should not be published are protected.


===== Usage =====
The protection mode is used in two configurations to determine the protection of:
  * [[lqpp#protection mode|low quality pages]]
  * pages with a [[lpp|published date in the past]]

===== Value =====

This configuration has two possibilities:
  * [[quality:automatic_hidden|Hidden]] (default) - The page is still accessible directly but is not searchable. A visitor coming from an external link (such as backlinks or email) will be able to see the page but the page will not be advertised to Search Engine.
  * ''ACL'' (''Access Control Lists'') - The page is not accessible to anonymous user. The user needs to log in to see the page.
