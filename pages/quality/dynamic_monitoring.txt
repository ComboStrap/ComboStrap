====== ComboStrap Quality - Dynamic Page Monitoring ======


===== About =====
''Dynamic Quality Page Monitoring'' is a feature that encourages the ''writer'' (users with edit permission) to improve the [[score|quality score]] of its page. 

A message is shown for [[rule|quality rules]] that don't pass indicating how they can be improved.




===== Example =====

For the low quality page demo ([[low_quality_example|low quality demo page]]), you would get the below note if you had the ''edit'' authorization.

<quality page-id="low_quality_example"/>

===== When the message shows up =====

The message is shown when:
  * [[rule|quality rules]] (that were not [[#excluded rules]]) don't pass
  * the [[low_quality_page|low quality page indicator]] has not been [[low_quality_page#manuall|set manually to false]]
===== Configuration =====
==== Excluded Quality Rules ====
The [[:configuration|configuration]] ''excludedQualityRulesFromDynamicMonitoring'' lists the [[rule|quality rules]] that should not be monitored.

If you had a [[rule|quality rule]] in this list, it will not show up in the message.
